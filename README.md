This repository contains code supplements for a reproducibility study of the paper "Revisiting Popularity and Demographic Biases in Recommender Evaluation and Effectiveness" by Neophytou et al. for the course Experiment Design for Data Science (188.992) at the Technical University of Vienna. The authors find statistically significant differences in recommender performance for demographic attributes. Additionally, they find that utility is higher for users from better represented countries and that total usage and the popularity of consumed content are strong predictors of recommender performance. Due to the ambiguous accounts of the procedure as well as the lacking description of some metrics used, we were only able to replicate parts of the paper. Our findings correspond largely with the results of the original study, with the exception of us failing to replicate statistical significance on NDCG scores for usage.
